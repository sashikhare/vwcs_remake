                    The objective of this course is to teach well control competency to drillers and others requiring a Level 3
                    certification. A secondary objective is to prepare participants for the IWCF Well Control exams. Certification is given
                    for Surface or Combined Surface and Subsea. BOP equipment, kick detection, shut-in procedures, kill sheets, and methods
                    of well control will be taught. The simulator work in the course focuses on detecting kicks, and closing in the well,
                    and handling an assortment of simulated problems.
