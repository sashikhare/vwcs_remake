        The objective of this course is to teach well control competency to drillers and others requiring a Level 3 certification. A
        secondary objective is to prepare participants for the IWCF Well Control exams. Certification is given for Surface or Combined
        Surface and Subsea. BOP equipment, kick detection, shut-in procedures, kill sheets, and methods of well control will be taught. The
        simulator work in the course focuses on detecting kicks, and closing in the well, and handling an assortment of simulated problems.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        The candidates will gain theoretical knowledge about well control and master practical skills necessary to apply the theoretical
        knowledge in blowout prevention and well control. At the end of this course, delegates should be able to demonstrate familiarity
        with an understanding of the simulation practical assessment, written examination in equipment, principles and procedures associated
        with rotary drilling well control in preparation for IWCF Well Control testing at Level 3. The successful candidate will be issued
        with a certificate valid for two years.

        The objective of this course is to teach well control competency to ToolPushers, OIMs, Wellsite Supervisors, Superintendents, and
        Engineers. A secondary objective is to prepare participants for the IWCF Well Control certification exams. Certification can be
        taken for Surface or Combined Surface and Subsea. BOP equipment, drilling fluids, barrier management, kick detection, shut-in
        procedures, kill sheets, various methods of well control, and organizing a well control operation are all taught in this course. A
        thorough understanding of how well control problems develop, how they should be solved, and how to prevent them will be discussed.
        There is an extensive amount of simulator work in the course with an assortment of simulated problems.
