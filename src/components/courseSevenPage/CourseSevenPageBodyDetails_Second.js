                                        The objective of this course is to teach well control competency to drillers and others requiring a Level 3 certification. A secondary objective is to prepare participants for the IWCF Well Control exams. Certification is given for Surface or Combined Surface and Subsea. BOP equipment, kick detection, shut-in procedures, kill sheets, and methods of well control will be taught. The simulator work in the course focuses on detecting kicks, and closing in the well, and handling an assortment of simulated problems.

                                        The candidates will gain theoretical knowledge about well control and master practical skills necessary to apply the theoretical knowledge in blowout prevention and well control. At the end of this course, delegates should be able to demonstrate familiarity with an understanding of the simulation practical assessment, written examination in equipment, principles and procedures associated with rotary drilling well control in preparation for IWCF Well Control testing at Level 3. The successful candidate will be issued with a certificate valid for two years.
