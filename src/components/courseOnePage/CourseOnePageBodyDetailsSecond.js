                    The objective is to lay a solid foundation in well control concepts and competency for entry-level rig operation
                    positions as well as those not directly associated with rig operation, such as office personnel. This course is strongly
                    recommended for first time well control candidates and prior to taking IWCF Well Control Course in Level 3 and then
                    Level 4. The objective of this training is to increase the candidates knowledge and understanding of well control
                    theory, practice and equipment. This will help prepare the candidates to deal with most well control situations.
