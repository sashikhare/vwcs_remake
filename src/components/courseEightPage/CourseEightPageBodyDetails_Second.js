                    The objective is to lay a solid foundation in well control
                    concepts and competency for entry-level rig operation
                    positions as well as those not directly associated with rig
                    operation, such as office personnel. This course is strongly
                    recommended for first time well control candidates and prior
                    to taking IWCF Well Control Course in Level 3 and then Level
                    4. The objective of this training is to increase the
                    candidates knowledge and understanding of well control
                    theory, practice and equipment. This will help prepare the
                    candidates to deal with most well control situations.

                    equipment, shut-in procedures, and basic methods of well
                    control etc. will be all covered. At the end of this course,
                    delegates should be able to demonstrate familiarity with an
                    understanding of the equipment, principles and procedures
                    associated with rotary drilling well control in preparation
                    for IWCF Well Control testing at Level 2. The successful
                    candidate will be issued with a certificate valid for five
                    years.
